  <p>
    My name is Kegang Peng, but you can call me Jimmy. I'm fluent in Cantonese
    and Mandarin. I was born in China and immigrated to the United States with
    my family in 2005, when I was 16 years old. Since then, Oakland has been my
    home.

  <p>
    After graduated from Oakland High School, I attended Laney College for about
    two years before dropping out in 2012 to work full time in the flooring
    trade with my family. In 2018, I earned my C-15 flooring contractor license
    and officially took over my family's{" "}
    <a href="http://www.minghardwoodfloor.com">hardwood flooring business</a>.
  </p>,
  <p>
    When COVID-19 hit, it was a tough time—but it also gave me a moment to
    reflect. I used that time to take an online course, pass the state exam, and
    become a licensed real estate agent. I soon realized that real estate wasn't
    for me, so I refocused on my flooring business.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Around that same time, I read Atomic Habits, which really shifted my
    mindset. It taught me the value of small steps and consistency. That
    motivation led me to pursue a long-time interest in computer science and
    technology.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Since then, I have been diving into coding and web development—learning
    JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and more. I even built a full-stack
    web app to support my{" "}
    <a href="http://www.minghardwoodfloor.com">hardwood flooring business</a>,
    which has helped streamline customer contact and improve my online presence.
    I love the creative and problem-solving side of tech and am now working
    toward transitioning into a career in software development.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Outside of work and school, I enjoy hiking, traveling, cars and keeping fish
    and shrimp, a hobby known as aquarium keeping or aquascaping. That said, I
    don't always have a lot of free time these days. I run my hardwood flooring
    business full time, attend California State University East bay full time,
    and I'm also a parent to two kids, ages 10 and 11.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Am I busy? Absolutely. But I don't want to stay in the construction industry
    forever. That is why I am back in school, step by step, aiming for a better
    future in tech. Better late than never!
